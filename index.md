[Digital Marketing Analysis - Google Merchandise Store Dashboard (Google Analytics, BigQuery, Tableau)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/angelo.chen/viz/GoogleAnalyticsDashboard_16443587309150/Dashboard)
<br><br>
Identified traffic patterns and visitor digital footprint to measure  effectiveness of Google e-commerce business store:
- Queried Google Analytics data in BigQuery to extract customer behavior from unnested hit-level raw data (1.4 million records)
- Re-created Google Analytics dimensions and metrics (total sessions, average duration on pages, bounce rate, etc.)
- Built dynamic dashboard which displays monthly/yearly traffic (total sessions, average pageviews, average duration) per source and per location, acquisition amounts per channel, and bounce rate per page
- Identified channel optimization opportunity and recommended optimal marketing budget allocation to drive further growth

[Online Retailer Marketing Analysis (Machine Learning, Feature Engineering, Python)](https://github.com/shuchangliang/Projects/blob/master/LTV%20%26%20Predicting%20Next%20Purchase%20Day.ipynb)
-	Performed analysis using rollup and drill down, slice and dice, sort and rank on 1 year of historical sales data for a global online retailer to compare monthly performance (e.g., growth rate, numbers of active customers, new customer ratio and retention rate, etc.)
-	Performed SWOT analysis on consumer marketing initiatives.
-	Used K-means to segment customers into 3 clusters (high, medium and low value), based on their recency, frequency and monetary values.
-	Performed customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis by using BG-NBD Model, and cohort analysis (retention over user & product lifetime).
-	A GridSearchCV tuned Random Forest multi-class Classifier (84% accuracy) was implemented to predict the CLV classes.

[Home Credit Default Risk Prediction (SQL, Machine Learning, Python)](https://github.com/shuchangliang/Projects/blob/master/Home%20Credit%20Default%20Risk.ipynb)
-	Calculated credit-to-income ratio, average income, numbers of bad debt and refused accounts, etc. for 300,000 records using SQL.
-	Prepared data by removing empty records and imputing missing values, and identified features correlated to defaulted accounts.
-	Transformed categorical variables into dummy variables using one-hot encoding.
-	Implemented and compared Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, the performance of the later method was improved by 17%.

[Post Marketing Campaign Analysis (A/B Testing, BI, SQL, Python)](https://github.com/shuchangliang/Projects/blob/master/Post%20Campaign%20Analysis%20rev.1.ipynb)
-	Acquired data from marketing campaigns of a Portugal bank, and implemented data pipeline with SQL connector in Python.
-	Visualized 10,000 campaign records in Plotly, an interactive plot enables segmentation of different campaigns and other characteristics (e.g. users per age group, valid offers per day).
-	Completed conversion and retention rate analysis, determining the most effective channel which obtained highest conversion rate (34%).
-	Applied A/B testing on the email channel, the statistical significance showed the customized emails improved marketing efficiency by 39%.
